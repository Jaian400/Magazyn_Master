# Magazyn Master 

Is this just an online store website developed to fulfill a university course requirement? Partly, but it offers much more than you might expect. The primary goal of this project is to create a system with integrated warehouse management functionality. The Django framework provides a robust and efficient solution for rapidly developing such a comprehensive system.
